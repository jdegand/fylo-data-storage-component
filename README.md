## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

### Continued development

- Semantic HTML
- Can only drag the slider backwards since a click event is not being handled.
- (Mobile) The higher the progress the more the bar covers the thumb of the slider til you can't see it or easily grab it 
- Margin on the thumb is very noticeable on desktop
